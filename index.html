            <p>In my free time, I love to cook. I am a foodie and enjoy trying and experimenting with dishes across different cuisines. I also love the outdoors and enjoy it through hiking.

            <p>In 2016, I participated in Round Square's annual conference that took place in Aiglon, Switzerland. Over the five days, I worked with studetns from all over the world to discuss global issues from a fresh perspective. We also took part in a service project where we built a footpath in the Alps for the local workers. I am also the co-founder of Ibtida e Tadbir, a non profit women adult literacy program operating in Karachi with 30 students.</p>
